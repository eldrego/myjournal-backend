# My Journal

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/eldrego/myjournal-backend/badge.svg?branch=staging)](https://coveralls.io/github/eldrego/myjournal-backend?branch=staging) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eldrego/myjournal-backend.svg?branch=staging)](https://travis-ci.org/eldrego/myjournal-backend)

## Requirements
* node `8.9.0`
* npm `^6.0.1`
* mongodb `3.6.3`

## Installation

Download and install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community)

Create a new MongoDB database. Retrieve your URI connection string. See examples [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/#examples)
Create your .env file and populate the relevant values based on the sample file .env-sample

After confirming that your environment meets the above requirements, you can create a new project based on `react-redux-starter-kit` by doing the following:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/eldrego/react-redux-starter-kit.git <my-project-name>
$ cd <my-project-name>
```

Then install dependencies

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start                     # Compiles the server-side and client side before the application launches
```
If everything works, you should get a message indicating so. In development Application will be served on port 8080
Open the web browser to http://localhost:8080/

While developing, leverage these additional scripts other than `npm start`;

|`npm run <script>`|Description|
|------------------|-----------|
|`start`|Serves your app for production at `localhost:8080`.|
|`dev`|Serves your app for development at `localhost:8080`. Watching files using Nodemon and Webpack's watch.|
|`test`|Runs unit tests with Jest, Mocha and generates a coverage report.|
